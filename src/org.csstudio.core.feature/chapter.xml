  <para>CSS Core is the group of plug-ins that every CSS distribution 
  has, regardless of product or site requirements. This set is kept as 
  small as possible, to avoid dependency creep-in. A plug-in is added 
  to this group only if, after a discussion on the mailing list, a 
  qualified majority emerges in favor of the inclusion.</para>
  <para>The <code>org.csstudio.core.feature</code> is used to maintain 
  the list of plug-ins that belong to this group.</para>
