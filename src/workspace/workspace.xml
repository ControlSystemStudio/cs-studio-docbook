<title>Workspace</title>

<para>Eclipse products use a <quote>Workspace</quote><indexterm><primary>Workspace</primary></indexterm>.
This is a directory that stores your configuration files and settings, allowing Eclipse to start up in the same state
as you left it when it was running the last time.
You can only run one instance of Eclipse for a selected workspace.

<para>In the previous chapter, we already used the workspace within the IDE.
We described the relationship between the actual location of CSS plugin source code
and the way these plugins appear in the IDE.
<xref linkend="fig_workspace"/> shows the similar relationship between
the workspace of a CSS end-user and the actual file system directory.
Directories and files in the workspace directory are visible in the <code>Navigator</code> view,
for example display files or Data Browser configuration files.
Double-clicking on these files will open them.
The actual workspace location and name of the workspace, i.e.
the <filename>/path/to/my/Workspace</filename> in the example,
is usually hidden from the end user.
Likewise, the <filename>.metadata</filename> directory where Eclipse
stores user preferences, the current location of windows etc. are
hidden from the user so that she can concentrate on just the files
of interest like display files.
</para>


<sect1> <title>Selecting a Workspace</title>

<para>Every Eclipse RCP application allows you to set the workspace when starting the product from the command-line
via the <code>-data</code> option:
</para>
<programlisting>the_css_product -data /path/to/my/Workspace
</programlisting>

<para>Most products also offer a menu item <code>File</code>, <code>Switch Workspace...</code>
that displays the current workspace location in the file system and allows you to select
a different one.
</para>

<para>Some products like the Eclipse IDE and the SNS version of CSS have a startup dialog
that prompts users for the workspace.
</para>
</sect1>



<sect1> <title>Projects, Saving Files, Default Project</title>

<para>The top-level elements of a Workspace are called <quote>Projects</quote><indexterm><primary>Projects in Workspace</primary></indexterm>.
They can be created via the menu <code>File</code>, <code>New...</code>.
</para>
<para>Each workspace must have at least one such project, because otherwise you cannot save any files.
Many versions of CSS therefore create a default project called <quote>CSS</quote> in case it does not
exist already when CSS is started up.
</para>
</sect1>



<sect1> <title>Linked Folders</title>

<para>Projects and sub-folders of a project in a user's Workspace are private to that user.
If you want to share configuration files with other CSS users, for example use common operator interface panels
or Data Browser configurations, you can link to a shared folder<indexterm><primary>Linked Folder</primary></indexterm>
in the file system.
</para>

<para>To manually create a linked folder:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Open the <code>Navigator</code> view.</listitem>
<listitem>Right-click on an existing project or folder.</listitem>
<listitem>Select <code>New...</code>, <code>Other...</code>, <code>General</code>, <code>Folder</code>, press <code>Next</code>.</listitem>
<listitem>Enter the desired folder name, but do <emphasis>not</emphasis> press <code>Finish</code>, yet!</listitem>
<listitem>Press the <code>Advanced...</code> button to select a <quote>Link to alternate location (Linked Folder)</quote>,
          browsing to the desired location outside of your workspace.</listitem>
<listitem>Now press <code>Finish</code>.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Your site probably already has a shared file system where people can store
files of interest to everybody which are then accessible from every computer in the
organization.
You can create a folder on that shared file system for sharing CSS files and then
add a link to that folder to every user's Workspace.
The SNS version of CSS as a <code>-share /path/to/shared/folder</code> command-line
option that automatically creates a shared folder <filename>CSS/Share</filename>
in the default <code>CSS</code> project of the workspace.
This way, every user can easily access the shared files, but also keep files in the
private workspace as desired.
