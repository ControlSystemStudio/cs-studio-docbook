<title>Network Usage by CSS</title>

<para>As a control system tool, CSS naturally performs
a certain amount of network communication.
For the most part, the CSS application that end users run
acts as a network client, while tools like the Alarm Server
will obviously also need to serve data.

<sect1> <title>Windows Firewall Warning</title>

<para>Even when running CSS as a client tool, you might
run into the Windows Firewall warning<indexterm><primary>Firewall Warning</primary></indexterm>
shown in <xref linkend="fig_firewall"/>.
</para>

<para>The message appears because even a client tool like CSS
does sometimes <emphasis>listen</emphasis> on network ports,
i.e. act as a server.
This usually happens for the following reasons:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>You configured logging to JMS (see <xref linkend="ch_logging"/> and <xref linkend="ch_jms"/>).
While connecting to JMS, CSS will also listen.
<!-- ... and I have no good explanation as to why -->
</listitem>
<listitem>You opened the online help.
Internally, this is implemented by CSS acting as a web server,
and the help viewer is an ordinary web browser.
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>You can usually cancel that firewall warning,
meaning Windows will <emphasis role="strong">block</emphasis> access
from other computers on the network to your instance of CSS.
Logging to JMS on another computer as well as local viewing
of the online help will be unaffected.

<sect1> <title>Required Firewall Exceptions</title>
<para>You might have to open firewall exceptions
for all the tools that <emphasis>serve</emphasis> data,
including
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Your RDB server</listitem>
<listitem>Your JMS server</listitem>
<listitem>Archive Engines for access to their status web server</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>For details you will have to refer to the documentation of your
firewall: Linux iptable, Windows firewall).
