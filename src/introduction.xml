<title>Introduction</title>

<para>There are fundamentally two ways to look at Control System Studio (CSS):
As an end user, or as a developer and system administrator.
This book is for the latter.
It is organized in a way that it might help somebody who is about
to install Control System Studio (CSS) at a site.
It starts with a general overview of what CSS <emphasis>is</emphasis>,
and then walks through the steps to compile pieces of CSS from source code,
how to set up an archive engine.

<para>As an end user in a the control room, you should be able to simply start
CSS. In your office, you might be able to download CSS from some local web page
for installation onto your office PC.
In either case, the CSS product that you get has already been pre-configured
for your site.
You can skip the initial chapters on installation etc. and jump ahead to the later
chapters that talk about how to use CSS.
