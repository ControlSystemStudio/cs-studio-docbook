  <para>
    CSS Core Utilities is the group of plug-ins that are supported to 
    be shared across different sites to provide commons functionality 
    among CSS applications, and constitute most of CSS core 
    infrastructure. This includes data definitions, connection 
    services, common Eclipse RCP items or utilities. A plug-in can be 
    added to this feature if the following conditions are met:
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>there is interested from more than one site in using 
      this plug-in</listitem>
      <listitem>the maintainer takes responsibility for support to 
      other sites</listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </para>
  <para>The <code>org.csstudio.core.util.feature</code> is used to 
  maintain the list of plug-ins that belong to this group, and is not 
  mandated to be packaged and distributed in a product (though one may 
  decide to do so).</para>
